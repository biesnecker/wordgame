A painfully simple little wordgame to help my son practice his vocabulary words.

Usage:

  python game.py n

where n is the number of words (randomly chosen from the word list) to review.

Press 1, 2, or 3 during review to move a word to the wrong (1), working (2), or
mastered (3) buckets. Keep going until all words have moved into the mastered
bucket, or press 'q' to quit early.

The word list is a plain text file, one entry per line. If you only want a part
of an entry to be colored, surround that part with dollar signs ($) -- see the
words.txt in this repository for examples.

It's silly and there's a lot more to do to make it anything more than silly, but
my son loves it and his reading has improved tremendously, so I'm happy with it.

I've released the code into the Public Domain (see COPYING.txt for details), and
hope that others will find it useful.
